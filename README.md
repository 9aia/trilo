**Trilo** is an experimental and minimal web app for restoring old, damaged, or faded photos. It uses modern Generative AI technology to recover lost detail and bring images back to life — all from a clean, easy-to-use interface. Just upload a photo, let the AI do the work, and download a renewed version of your memory.
